**“4ˮ**

This was simple encryption where every 4 characters (from index 0  3, 4  7 etc) were being jumbled.

if 0 1 2 3 were the indices of the first 4 characters it was jumbled and replaced in the order 1 2 0 3 as show in the encrypt function, so you had to write a suitable decrypt function to decode this.
