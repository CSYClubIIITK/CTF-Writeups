## Writeup
🔥 Welcome, Pokémon Trainer! 🔥
Hello there! Welcome to the world of Pokémon! 🌍⚡
I’m Professor Oak, the leading Pokémon researcher, and I’ve been working on an advanced Pokédex upgrade that can automatically classify Pokémon types using cutting-edge neural networks. This breakthrough could revolutionize how trainers understand their Pokémon!
BUT… there’s been a slight hiccup in the lab. 😰
My Pikachu got a little too excited and—well, let’s just say a few crucial data files were shocked into oblivion. ⚡💥 Now, the entire system is scrambled, and I need your help to restore order and complete the classifier!
Now.. For further details, access the PDF. Heads up!! It's password protected. The password is the name of the pokemon Ash first captured. Good Luck Trainer !!!
